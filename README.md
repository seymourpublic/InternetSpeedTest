# InternetSpeedTest
basic command line network speed test built using node
This JavaScript code uses the "network-speed" library to measure and display both download and upload speeds for a network connection. Here's a description of what the code does:
It imports the "network-speed" library, which provides functionality to measure network speeds.
It initializes an instance of the NetworkSpeed class as testNetworkSpeed.
The getDownloadSpeed function is defined. This function measures the download speed by fetching a file from a specified URL (baseurl) with a known file size (fileSizeInBytes). The download speed is then logged to the console.
The getDownloadSpeed function is called using getDownloadSpeed().
The getUploadSpeed function is defined. This function measures the upload speed by making a POST request to a specified hostname and path (options) with a known file size (fileSizeInBytes). The upload speed is then logged to the console.
The getUploadSpeed function is called using getUploadSpeed().
Overall, this code allows you to assess the download and upload speeds of a network connection by fetching files and making HTTP requests with known file sizes, making it useful for network performance testing and monitoring
